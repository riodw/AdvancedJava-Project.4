A maze is implemented as a two-dimensional character array in which passages are marked with 0s, walls by 1s, exit position by the letter e and the initial position by the letter b. For example,
1 1 1 1 1                          
b 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 e
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
is a maze that has only one solution:
1 1 1 1 1
b p 1 0 1
1 p 1 p e
1 p p p 1
1 1 1 1 1

Write a program that asks the user to enter the dimensions of a maze and the maze, finds and prints out graphical solutions of all possible paths (a solution is printed for each path, each maze entered may have multiple solutions) by replacing  the 0s with ps in each path like the above example. 
Make sure that your program is object-oriented and has professional documentation and appropriate indentation. You are not required to hand in your java document generated by javadoc any more.
A sample maze you may use is
11111111111
10000010001
10100010101
e0100000101
10111110101
10101000101
10001010001
11111010001
101b1010001
10000010001
